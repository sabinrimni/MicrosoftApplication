# MicrosoftApplication
Simple implementation of cashier's algorithm and string manipulation through operator overload in C# and .NET Core 2

### Structure ###
The solution has 2 projects `MakeChange` and `StringManipulation` each containing the implementation of their respective problems.

### Running the projects ###
The solution does not have an executable as the projects are test suits for the implementations. As such it should be opened in Visual Studio and executed from there.

* Requires .NET Core 2
* Requires Nuget dependency of NUnit 3.11
* Requires Nuget dependency of NUnit3TestAdapter
* Requires Nuget dependency of Microsoft.NET.Test.Sdk
